# Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game

This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons.

## What the player is to expect from the game

Expect a fun way to exercise your memory and a shinny trophy when you won, showing your game data such as:

* [Star rating]
* [Total time spent in the current session]
* [Total moves made in the current session]

## Instructions

* [Click on a card]
* [Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.]
* [Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time]
* [Match the card within time limit of 5 min]
* [Don't leave the game ideal more than 2 min]
